## Post #2 - Build a Website
*Last Updated: February 8, 2025*

*How was this blog put together?*

Check out the source out on github: [daclev/darrellcleveland.com](https://github.com/daclev/darrellcleveland.com). ðŸ˜‹

## Really, How was the site put together?

A mix of the [React Markdown Blog](https://github.com/willjw3/react-markdown-blog) tutorial, googling, and chatgpt.ðŸ¤–ðŸ¤–ðŸ¤– 

Most of my time is spent working in backend environments. My frontend skills (such as making this site), written in javascript and css are a work in progress ðŸ˜Š. The react markdown blog tutorial was a big jump start.

Websites need a few components to operate, e.g. here are mine  
| Need    | Description  |
|----------|:------------|
| Domain | [darrellcleveland.com](https://darrellcleveland.com/) |
| Hosting | [github](https://github.com/) (free - up to 5 gigabytes before there is any real worries) |
| Code | this is wrote using the [React framework](https://create-react-app.dev/) |
| Security | SSL/TLS/etc. I'm leaving this to [cloudflare](https://www.cloudflare.com/)|
| Deployability | github using [gh-pages](https://create-react-app.dev/docs/deployment/#github-pages)|
| DNS | hook the deployment (host) and domain together. Use DNS records such as A, CNAME, so on.. |
| Database | somewhere to store data (I'm using Markdown files from a directory.. close enough) |

Additionally, large systems will need backend applications to handle request and queries from clients. There are various forms of what this could look like and could require a bit of knowledge depending on the complexity. I'll stop here and leave others to go search, study, and explore backend components. It is a big world out there. I'd suggest finding what you enjoy and dive deep into that.

## Parting Thoughts on Building a Website
 Building a website can be fun and as simple or complex as the developer(s) would like or need to make it.
 There are many examples, tutorials, documentation, and communities to help support someone who wants to start.

 If someone is looking for an easier - less code/no code option. There are plenty of sites that support this. Prebuilt templates will most likely offer what someone would want for a very simple site, such as a blog or info page. 

 If someone is looking for something more custom, then digging into a language such as javascript or typescript might be the way to go. Or, hire a developer to help create what your heart desires.
