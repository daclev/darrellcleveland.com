## Post #1 - Why Blog?
*Last Updated: January 31, 2025*

*tldr - my purpose for this is to share content that I have found helpful in some way with others..*

Welcome to my blog! üëãüèª  
This is a space where one post my not follow another, content should be used with great care (**I'm not liability for other's decisions**, only trying to conjure good vibes), and most thoughts are not my own but are presented through my lens. Credit will be given where credit is due. 

"It is our choices, Harry, that show what we truly are, far more than our abilities"  -Albus Dumbledore

## What this blog is not.
It is not any sort of communal platform. There are no plans to offer others an opportunity to comment.  
    
 However, others may contact me. If you find a significate error, send me an email with the issue and if you're correct, I'll give you a shout-out in the fixed content!

 Being DENVERCODER9, not the goal.

 ## Parting Thoughts on Blog Goals
 Everyone should blog!   
 It is a great way to give back, reflect on prior experience, and share information that may be helpful to others.

Thanks for reading!  
And, hope you read on.
