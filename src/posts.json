To keep the runtime-environment minimal, a helpful tool to look into is JLink. The JLink tool is good for obtaining the required JRE modules to run the program. We want this because it means a smaller deployment size, faster application startup, and better memory management.\n\n```java\njlink --module-path $JAVA_HOME/jmods \\\n      --add-modules java.base,java.desktop \\\n      --output /the/output/path\n```\n\n| Arguments    | Description  |\n|----------|:------------|\n| --module-path <path> | the path to the JDK modules (JARs) |\n| --add-modules <modules> | adds necessary modules  |\n| --output <path> | the designated output directory for the runtime image |\n| --compress <i> | controls the compression level 0 (default, no compression), 1 string, 2 zip |\n| --no-header-files | reduces the disk space but prevents JNI |\n| --no-man-pages | excludes the man pages from being included in the image |\n| --strip-debug | removes debugging content to further reduce the image |\n\nThere are additional arguments to consider to completely minimize the required runtime environment. Some actions may reduce the footprint, but make cause harm to the runtime such as fully compressing (slower startup) or removing debugging information (reduced information in stack traces, no stepping code with a debugger, limited profiling, no remote debugger).\n\n### HOLD UP ‚úãüèº\nHow do you know what modules to add to your program?  \n\nHere is the first tool we should have looked at:  \n[jdeps](https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/23/docs/specs/man/jdeps.html) can be used to list the dependent modules in your program. \n\n```java\njdeps --list-deps daprogram.jar\n\noutput:\ndaprogram.jar -> java.base\ndaprogram.jar -> java.desktop\ndaprogram.jar -> whatever the modules are..\n```\n\nAt this point the modules are known, so go back to using the jlink command to add the modules that are needed to create a minimal runtime image. `java.base` is added by default, the other modules are what's important . After the jlink command runs we are ready to use jpackage.\n\n## Its Time to Package this up üì¶\n\nTo create an installer we just need to run the jpackage command. \n\nBefore doing so there is some information to cover. To keep it simple, whatever environment (linux, mac, windows) is used to run jlink (to create a runtime image) and jpackage (to create the installer), is the package compile type that is being targeted for the end JRE. So, if this is not the goal, then one option might be to build for another OS using containerization. In other words, run this in docker (or something similar) for the target OS. Do not forget to consider the architecture! The target system might be arm64v8 or amd64 or whatever. If that is the case, do not build on a different machine and expect the installer to run. Find the correct build needs for the system first.\n\nNow what we have all been waiting for,\n\n```java\njpackage --type deb \\\n         --name daapp \\\n         --app-version 1.0.0 \\\n         --main-jar daprogram.jar \\\n         --main-class com.company.daapp.Application \\\n         --runtime-image /output/path/from/jlink \\\n         --output /path/to/output\n```\n\n| Arguments    | Description  |\n|----------|:------------|\n| --type <T> | the package type (deb, pkg, msi, etc.) |\n| --name <N> | the app name |\n| --main-jar <jar>| the main jar of the application |\n| --main-class <class-path> | the main class to run |\n| --runtime-image <path> | the path to the jdk runtime image (jlink output) |\n| --output <path> | the output directory for jpackage |\n\nThat is all there is to building a simple installer for your program. \nThere is more to learn about the topic, the information provided here is merely to get started.\n\nHope this content is helpful.  \nThanks for reading!"},{"id":1736575200,"title":"Building this Site","author":"Darrell Cleveland","date":"January 11, 2025","content":"\n## Post #2 - Build a Website\n*Last Updated: February 8, 2025*\n\n*How was this blog put together?*\n\nCheck out the source out on github: [daclev/darrellcleveland.com](https://github.com/daclev/darrellcleveland.com). üòã\n\n## Really, How was the site put together?\n\nA mix of the [React Markdown Blog](https://github.com/willjw3/react-markdown-blog) tutorial, googling, and chatgpt.ü§ñü§ñü§ñ \n\nMost of my time is spent working in backend environments. My frontend skills (such as making this site), written in javascript and css are a work in progress üòä. The react markdown blog tutorial was a big jump start.\n\nWebsites need a few components to operate, e.g. here are mine  \n| Need    | Description  |\n|----------|:------------|\n| Domain | [darrellcleveland.com](https://darrellcleveland.com/) |\n| Hosting | [github](https://github.com/) (free - up to 5 gigabytes before there is any real worries) |\n| Code | this is wrote using the [React framework](https://create-react-app.dev/) |\n| Security | SSL/TLS/etc. I'm leaving this to [cloudflare](https://www.cloudflare.com/)|\n| Deployability | github using [gh-pages](https://create-react-app.dev/docs/deployment/#github-pages)|\n| DNS | hook the deployment (host) and domain together. Use DNS records such as A, CNAME, so on.. |\n| Database | somewhere to store data (I'm using Markdown files from a directory.. close enough) |\n\nAdditionally, large systems will need backend applications to handle request and queries from clients. There are various forms of what this could look like and could require a bit of knowledge depending on the complexity. I'll stop here and leave others to go search, study, and explore backend components. It is a big world out there. I'd suggest finding what you enjoy and dive deep into that.\n\n## Parting Thoughts on Building a Website\n Building a website can be fun and as simple or complex as the developer(s) would like or need to make it.\n There are many examples, tutorials, documentation, and communities to help support someone who wants to start.\n\n If someone is looking for an easier - less code/no code option. There are plenty of sites that support this. Prebuilt templates will most likely offer what someone would want for a very simple site, such as a blog or info page. \n\n If someone is looking for something more custom, then digging into a language such as javascript or typescript might be the way to go. Or, hire a developer to help create what your heart desires.\n\nThanks for reading!
