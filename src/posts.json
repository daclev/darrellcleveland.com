My frontend skills (such as making this site), written in javascript and css are a work in progress üòä. The react markdown blog tutorial was a big jump start.\n\nWebsites need a few components to operate, e.g. here are mine  \n| Need    | Description  |\n|----------|:------------|\n| Domain | [darrellcleveland.com](https://darrellcleveland.com/) |\n| Hosting | github (free - up to 5 gigabytes before there is any real worries) |\n| Code | such as the React framework |\n| Security | SSl/TLS such as [cloudflare](https://www.cloudflare.com/)|\n| Deployability | github using gh-pages|\n| DNS | hook the deployment (host) and domain together. Use DNS records such as A, CNAME, so on.. |\n| Database | somewhere to store data (I'm using Markdown files from a directory.. close enough) |\n\nAdditionally, large systems will need backend applications to handle request and queries from clients. There are various forms of what this could look like and could require a bit of knowledge depending on the complexity. I'll stop here and leave others to go search, study, and explore backend components. It is a big world out there. I'd suggest finding what you enjoy and dive deep into that.\n\n## Parting Thoughts on Building a Website\n Building a website can be fun and as simple or complex as the developer(s) would like or need to make it.\n There are many examples, tutorials, documentation, and communities to help support someone who wants to start.\n\n If someone is looking for an easier - less code/no code option. There are plenty of sites that support this. Prebuilt templates will most likely offer what someone would want to for a very simple site, such as a blog or info page. \n\n If someone is looking for something more custom, then digging into a language such as javascript or typescript might be the way to go. Or, hire a developer to help create what your heart desires.\n\nThanks for reading!  \nHope you read on."},{"id":1735970400,"title":"Blog Goals","author":"Darrell Cleveland","date":"January 4, 2025","content":"\n## Post #1 - Why Blog?\n*Last Updated: January 31, 2025*\n\n*tldr - my purpose for this is to share content that I have found helpful in some way with others..*\n\nWelcome to my blog! üëãüèª  \nThis is a space where one post my not follow another, content should be used with great care (**I'm not liability for other's decisions**, only trying to conjure good vibes), and most thoughts are not my own but are presented through my lens.
